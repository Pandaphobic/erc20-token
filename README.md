# Testing ERC20 Token / Web3 / React

Welcome to my first ever ERC20 token! I used remix to deploy to a local Ganache instance. For now, this has only been tested with MetaMask.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the front end app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
